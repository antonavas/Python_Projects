## SALES ANALYSIS PROJECT

This project is a sales analysis for a store using the pandas library for data processing and matplotlib for visualization and includes the next steps:

1. Data Preparation: The data was loaded, checked for missing values and duplicates, cleaned, and new columns (such as the order month) were added.
2. Monthly Sales Analysis: An analysis was conducted to identify the best month for sales. A graph shows that December is the most successful month, likely due to the holiday shopping season.
3. City-wise Sales Analysis: The analysis identified which cities recorded the highest number of orders. San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York had the highest order counts.
4. Top-Selling Products: The analysis determined which products sell the most. Batteries (AAA and AA) were the most popular items, likely due to their low price and high demand.
5. Frequently Sold Product Combinations: A study was done to find pairs of products that are often bought together. For instance, iPhones are frequently purchased with Lightning charging cables, and Google Phones with USB-C cables.
6. Data Visualization: The project uses visualizations extensively to display various sales aspects, such as city-wise distribution, monthly sales volumes, product popularity, and combinations of products often sold together.

Key Findings:

- December is the best month for sales.- San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York are the cities with the highest number of orders.
- The top-selling items are batteries and phone accessories.
- Certain products are frequently purchased together, which could be leveraged for cross-selling.
- This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, from data cleaning and preparation to deriving actionable business insights
